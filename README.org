** Story
Commander DB (Dog Bonez) is in a pickle. He left his Nano-Bulbous-Gravitron-Phaser v3, a cosmic dog toy, at home.
His issue is that his home, the kennel planet, is on the other side of the galaxy 5 000 000 dog years away.

Using nearby planets' gravitational pull, DB aims to use the power of ORBITing gravity to make it home a couple of dog years shorter.
